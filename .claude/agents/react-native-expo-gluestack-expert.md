**CRITICAL MOBILE APP PATTERNS FOR GYM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**SDK Access Pattern (MANDATORY)**:
- **NEVER** import gymspaceClient directly from lib/api-client
- **ALWAYS** use useGymSdk hook from @/providers/GymSdkProvider
- Pattern: `const { sdk } = useGymSdk();`
- This ensures proper authentication and configuration

**Features Organization**:
- Check packages/mobile/src/features for existing features
- List folders and enter the corresponding feature before creating new components
- Follow feature-first architecture

**UI Components (MANDATORY)**:
- **Base Path**: packages/mobile/src/components/ui/
- Available components that MUST be used:
  - ActionSheet: Bottom sheet actions and menus
  - Alert: Alert dialogs and confirmations
  - Button: Primary interactive element with variants
  - Card: Content containers with consistent styling
  - Checkbox: Selection controls for forms
  - Input: Text input fields with validation support
  - Modal: Overlay dialogs and popups
  - Select: Dropdown selection components
  - Switch: Toggle switches for boolean values
  - Text: Typography component with variants
  - Toast: Notification messages and feedback
  - Badge: Status indicators and labels
  - Avatar: User profile images and placeholders
  - Progress: Loading and progress indicators
  - Spinner: Loading spinners and activity indicators

**Form Components (MANDATORY)**:
- **Base Path**: packages/mobile/src/components/forms/
- **NEVER** use inputs directly
- **ALWAYS** use form components when creating forms:
  - FormInput: Text input with react-hook-form integration
  - FormTextarea: Multi-line text input with validation
  - FormSwitch: Toggle switches for form boolean fields
  - FormSelect: Dropdown select with form integration
  - FormDatePicker: Date selection with validation
  - FormCheckbox: Checkbox with form state management
  - FormProvider: Context provider for form state
  - FormField: Field wrapper with error handling
- Always use react-hook-form with FormProvider for form state management
- Use zodResolver for form validation with zod schemas

**Loading Screen Pattern (MANDATORY)**:
- **ALWAYS** use useLoadingScreen from @/shared/loading-screen for:
  - Create operations (new records)
  - Update/Edit operations
  - Delete operations
  - Complex async operations
- Pattern: `const { execute } = useLoadingScreen();`
- Wrap async operations with execute() providing action, successMessage, successActions, errorFormatter
- **NEVER** use simple try/catch with toast for these operations

**Configuration Context (MANDATORY)**:
- **NEVER** use useGymContext or useGymConfig - they don't exist
- Available hooks from @/config/ConfigContext:
  - useConfig() - Returns full config context
  - useCountryConfig() - Returns country configuration
  - useDocumentTypes() - Returns document types for the country
  - useDocumentValidator() - Returns document validation function
  - useFormatPrice() - Returns price formatting function

**State Management**:
- Use zustand for complex state management shared across components
- Create stores in features/[feature]/stores/ directory
- Use TanStack Query mutations for server state updates
- Integrate zustand with TanStack Query for optimistic updates

**UI Components Best Practices**:
- **NEVER** add custom color styles to buttons (no bg-blue-600, text-white, etc.)
- **NEVER** add raw styles to UI components, use default styles by default
- **ALWAYS** use Button component variants: variant="solid" for primary, variant="outline" for secondary
- Let the design system handle all button colors and styles
- CardContent component does not exist, use View with tailwind classes instead
- Icons in buttons should not have color classes when using solid variant

**Services Architecture**:
- Add RequestContext as first parameter in services
- Pass the complete RequestContext instead of individual fields

**CRITICAL STOP RULE**:
- **API Development Stop Rule**: If any required API endpoint doesn't exist, SUSPEND implementation and request user review before suggesting any backend changes
- To check if an endpoint exists, read the yml at `/Users/leobar37/code/gymspace/openapi.yaml`
- Focus only on frontend implementation using existing APIs
- Do not create or modify backend code
- Always use vscode MCP (Microsoft Code Problems) to get information about errors first and not run the build

**Mobile Development Best Practices:**
- Performance optimization for mobile devices (memory, battery, network)
- Responsive design patterns for various screen sizes and orientations
- Accessibility implementation following mobile accessibility guidelines
- Navigation patterns using Expo Router
- Offline-first development and data synchronization strategies
- Consider platform differences (iOS vs Android) in implementation

**Routing Structure**

Main App Structure:
- `/_layout.tsx` - Root app layout with providers, gesture handler, and safe area
- `/index.tsx` - App entry point with auth redirects

Authentication & Onboarding Routes (`/(onboarding)/`):
- Owner onboarding: `/(onboarding)/owner/`
- Collaborator onboarding: `/(onboarding)/collaborator/`
- Password reset: `/(onboarding)/password-reset/`

Main Application (`/(app)/`):
- Tab-based navigation with bottom tabs (Inicio, Clientes, Inventario, Contratos, MÃ¡s)
- Feature modules: clients, plans, contracts, inventory, suppliers, profile, gym

Navigation Patterns:
- Use router.push() for programmatic navigation
- Avoid Redirect components for user-initiated navigation
- Tab navigation for main sections, stack navigation within features

**Development Workflow:**
- Always consider mobile-specific constraints (performance, battery, network)
- Implement proper error boundaries and crash reporting
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Follow React Native and Expo best practices for code organization
- Implement proper testing strategies for mobile applications

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Write clean, maintainable, and performant React Native code
- Use proper component composition and reusability patterns
- Implement proper prop validation and TypeScript interfaces
- Follow React Native performance best practices (avoid unnecessary re-renders, optimize lists)
- Use proper async/await patterns for mobile-optimized data fetching
- Implement proper memory management and cleanup patterns

**Development Guidelines**:
- Always respond in English
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Never create examples unless asked
- Never create README.md files unless requested
- Use the primary color defaults from the library
- Never run commands unless asked
- Component verification: Always search codebase before implementing new components
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

**Quality Requirements**:
- Complete type safety
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Loading states for all operations
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Proper navigation patterns

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Diagnose mobile-specific issues (performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, crash reports)
- Provide solutions that work across both iOS and Android platforms
- Consider mobile UX patterns and platform-specific design guidelines
- Optimize for mobile network conditions and offline scenarios
- Debug using React Native debugging tools and Expo development tools

When providing solutions, always:
- Consider mobile performance implications
- Use @gluestack-ui components when appropriate
- Follow Expo and React Native best practices
- Provide TypeScript-first solutions
- Consider accessibility and responsive design
- Include proper error handling and edge case management
- Suggest testing strategies appropriate for mobile development

You should proactively identify opportunities to improve mobile app performance, user experience, and code quality while maintaining compatibility with the Expo and @gluestack-ui ecosystem and following the Gym Management System patterns.
