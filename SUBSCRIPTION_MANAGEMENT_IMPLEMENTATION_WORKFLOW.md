```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant API as API Dev
    participant SDK as SDK Dev  
    participant FE as Frontend Dev
    
    API->>SDK: Create base DTOs & types
    SDK->>FE: Provide type definitions
    FE->>API: Validate admin auth requirements
    API->>FE: Provide auth middleware patterns
```

#### Phase 2-6: Parallel Development with Integration Points
```typescript
// Daily Coordination Protocol
✅ Daily standup with integration status
✅ API-first development (endpoints before UI)
✅ SDK synchronization after each API change
✅ Frontend integration testing after SDK updates

// Integration Checkpoints
✅ End of each sprint: Full integration testing
✅ Mid-sprint: API contract validation
✅ Feature completion: E2E workflow testing
```

### Communication Protocol
